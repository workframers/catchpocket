Two tools for lacinia / datomic integration

https://github.com/workframers/stillsuit

https://github.com/workframers/catchpocket

== Agenda

* Brief intro to lacinia
* Stillsuit
* Catchpocket

== Brief intro to lacinia

* http://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[lacinia] is a library from WalmartLabs that
  implements the server-side of GraphQL in Clojure. It works by accepting a **GraphQL schema**
  and a set of **resolvers**.
* It is awesome and has great documentation!

== Lacinia: execution model

* Lacinia resolvers can be divided into roughly two types.

1. **Query resolvers** produce data from nowhere.
2. **Field resolvers** are used to navigate graph data.

* The beauty of lacinia is the ability to intercept its
 execution at any stage of the graph.

== Lacinia: GraphQL schema

This schema defines two objects and one top-level query.

[source, clojure]
----
{:objects {:Artist {:fields {:name   {:type String}
                             :id     {:type Int}
                             :albums {:type    (list :Album)
                                      :resolve [:my/album-resolver]}}}
           :Album  {:fields {:name   {:type String}
                             :year   {:type Int}
                             :tracks {:type    (list :Track)
                                      :resolve [:my/track-resolver]}}}}
 :queries {:Artist {:type    :Artist
                    :args    {:id {:type (non-null Int)}}
                    :resolve [:my/artist-query]}}}
----

The `:resolve` keys are where we hook into lacinia's execution.

== Lacinia: Queries

Getting albums from the previous schema:

[source, graphql]
----
query getAlbums($id: Int) {
  Artist(id: $id) {
    name
    albums {
      name
      year
    }
  }
}
----

* This will call the `:Artist` query resolver and the `:albums` field resolver.

== Lacinia: Resolvers

To actually generate data, lacinia calls **resolvers**
that you provide to it.

[source, clojure]
----
(defn- artist-resolver
  [context arguments value]
  {:name "The Beatles" :id 1 :albums []})

;; This is passed to (lacinia/execute)
(def my-resolver-map
  {:my/artist-resolver artist-resolver})
----

* The `value` argument contains the data structure returned by the parent resolver.

== Datomic Entity API

Datomic's https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/entities.html[Entity API] provides a convenient
interface to the graphier bits of datomic's data model.

* With the entity API, the attributes of entities are _lazily resolved_.
* This is a good fit for the GraphQL model, where the client may not request every field of entity
* Note that it is not available in Datomic Cloud, however

== Stillsuit: basic idea

https://github.com/workframers/stillsuit[`stillsuit`] is a library that provides
features for accessing datomic databases via lacinia resolvers. It provides:

* A way of stashing a datomic connection in the Lacinia `context`
* Resolvers which resolve primitive API attributes (int, string, etc) from datomic entities
* Resolvers to handle `:db.type/ref` attributes (graph edges)

== Stillsuit: more features

* Scalars to serialize and deserialize most datomic types to strings
* Support for GraphQL enums represented as datomic enum attributes or keyword values
* Query resolvers for entities based on datomic unique attributes
* datomic back-reference support

[%notitle]
== Stillsuit: basic attribute access


[source, clojure]
----
{:objects
 {:Person
  {:fields
   {:name       {:type String}
    :id         {:type :JavaLong}
    :isVerified {:type    (non-null Boolean)
                 :resolve [:stillsuit/ref
                           {:stillsuit/attribute    :person/verified?
                            :stillsuit/lacinia-type Boolean}]}}}}}
----

* Expose `:person/verified?` attribute of a `:person` entity as the GraphQL field `isVerified`
* `:person/name` and `:person/id` will be resolved by the *default resolver*.

[%notitle]
== Stillsuit: basic attribute access

[source, clojure]
----
{:objects
 {:Person
  {:fields
   {:projects
    {:type    (list (non-null :Project))
     :resolve [:stillsuit/ref
               #:stillsuit{:attribute    :project/_members
                           :lacinia-type :Project
                           :sort-key     :project/name}]}}}}}
----

* A `:project` entity may refer to a set of people via `:project/members`
* This definition sets up the backwards link from a person to the projects

== Stillsuit: execution model

[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/workframers/stillsuit/develop/doc/stillsuit-summary.png?token=AAFxEnFZ-ofbOsMpWVc5CB729WjMtvfDks5a3lpywA%3D%3D]
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/workframers/stillsuit/develop/doc/stillsuit-summary.png?token=AAFxEnFZ-ofbOsMpWVc5CB729WjMtvfDks5a3lpywA%3D%3D[summary,967,840]

== Stillsuit: basic API

* Stillsuit takes as input all of the things you would normally pass to `(lacinia/execute)`,
  plus a config map and a datomic connection.
* Its main function, `(stillsuit/decorate)`, adds a bunch of stillsuit stuff to that
* You can then pass the result to lacinia, or there's a simple wrapper to have stillsuit call lacinia
* Stillsuit itself consists of a bunch of library routines implementing resolvers etc

== Stillsuit: what you write

* Configuration mapping datomic attributes to GraphQL fields
* Query resolvers that return entities
* Query resolvers that return lists of entities
* Field resolvers for derived data
* Mutation resolvers that (may) transact data

== Stillsuit: execution API sample

[source, clojure]
----
(defn run-query [query variables]
  (let [options   #:stillsuit{:schema     (load-schema-file)
                              :config     {}
                              :connection (d/connect "datomic:ddb://foo")
                              :resolvers  {:my/artist-resolver artist-resolver}}
        decorated (stillsuit/decorate options)
        schema    (:stillsuit/schema decorated)
        context   (:stillsuit/app-context decorated)]
    (lacinia/execute schema query variables context)))
----

(`query` and `variables` would be coming from your http request here)

== Stillsuit: execution convenience wrapper

[source, clojure]
----
(defn run-query [query variables]
  (let [options   #:stillsuit{:schema     (load-schema-file)
                              :config     {}
                              :connection (d/connect "datomic:ddb://foo")
                              :resolvers  {:my/artist-resolver artist-resolver}}
        decorated (stillsuit/decorate options)]
    (stillsuit/execute decorated query variables)))
----

(This is equivalent to the last slide)

== Stillsuit: limitations

* I have no idea what your database looks like
** Therefore stillsuit's data-model assumptions may not be correct for your data
* Datomic Cloud is not supported (no Entity API)
* Pagination can be problematic for `ref` attributes
* Schema files can get pretty verbose

== Catchpocket: basic idea

* Stillsuit provides an easy interface to datomic
* But you still have to write a lot of stuff by hand
** A lot: every attribute you want to expose

https://github.com/workframers/catchpocket[`catchpocket`] scans an existing
datomic database and auto-generates a stillsuit configuration for you.

== Catchpocket - features

* Creates stillsuit field definitions for every datomic attribute it can find
* Creates object definitions by inference from datomic attribute namespaces
** You can whitelist or blacklist datomic attributes and/or namespaces
* Exposes datomic `:db/doc` data as GraphQL descriptions

== Catchpocket - more features

* Generation of queries for every entity with a unique attribute
* Configurable name generation (`camelCase` / `snake_case` etc)
* Generates GraphQL enums from keyword or datomic enum references
** Capable of scanning a database to generate values

== Catchpocket - running / execution

* Just a bunch of Clojure code(tm)
* Run from `lein` and/or `deps.edn` from command-line
* Can be run as a library, but probably works better as a build step
  (dependencies assume it will be a build step)

== Catchpocket - diagram

[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/workframers/catchpocket/develop/doc/overview.png?token=AAFxEqiudSJpDEmBN9QVMs7WgV6mGXwGks5a30HQwA%3D%3D]

== Catchpocket - ref generation

* Datomic graph edges (`:db.type/ref`) can point to any type of entity
* Therefore you need to tell catchpocket what type you expect the other node to be
* Most straightforward way is via the catchpocket config
* You can also attach catchpocket metadata to the attributes themselves

== Catchpocket - more ref generation

* All datomic edges are two-way; catchpocket will generate both sides of the link
* Reasonably smart about cardinality, overrideable
** You can tell it a backref is cardinality-one

== Catchpocket - sample

[source, clojure]
----
{:catchpocket/references
 {:secret-agent/country-of-origin
  {:catchpocket/reference-to :Country
   :catchpocket/backref-name :secret_agents}}}
----

* A secret agent entity has a `:secret-agent/country-of-origin` attribute
* This config generates a `country_of_origin` field in the `Agent` object
* It also auto-generates a `secret_agents` field in the `Country` object

== Current state of the projects

* catchpocket and stillsuit are both alpha software, and their APIs might change
* We use them, but for low-traffic, relatively "small data" applications
* Focus has been on features, not performance
* Definitely interested in feedback
** We only know what our own schemas look like
* Published under the Apache 2 license

== Some things we want to add

* Docs need some love
** Our goal is quality parity with lacinia docs
* Pagination of large result sets
* Exposing datomic features (history API, etc)
* Better spec validation of config files
* Union types

== Thanks!
